The project leverages modern technologies and best practices for scalability and maintainability.

## Features

- User registration and authentication (JWT)
- Profile creation and update with photo upload (Cloudinary)
- Social posts with file/image support
- Comments and reactions on posts
- Real-time chat between users (Socket.IO)
- Notifications for new posts and interactions
- Role-based access control
- PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM
